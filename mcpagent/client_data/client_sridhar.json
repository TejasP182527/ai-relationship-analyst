    "Hello Mr. Sridhar, with your retirement corpus of ₹2.5 Cr, our goal is income stability and capital preservation. We've split ₹1 Cr into senior citizen savings schemes, ₹75L into RBI floating-rate bonds, and ₹50L into ultra short-term debt funds. Your monthly income is now ₹95,000 after taxes. Health insurance premium for you and your spouse is up for renewal; let’s explore a super top-up this year. Also, your two FDs maturing next month can be rolled into the same laddering strategy for liquidity.",
    "In today’s review, we discussed the nomination gaps in your DEMAT and EPFO. Please complete the online KYC revalidation by 31st March. On estate planning, a registered will is pending—we'll coordinate with the legal desk to get a draft. On tax, Section 80TTB allows interest deduction up to ₹50,000 for senior citizens, which applies to your SBI and HDFC FDs. Your mutual fund holdings are conservative hybrid, and returns are around 6.8%—no rebalancing needed this quarter."
