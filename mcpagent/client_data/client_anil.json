    "Hi Anil, as an NRI based in Singapore, your portfolio is showing consistent returns. However, there's an increasing TDS deduction on your Indian dividend income. I suggest routing dividends into a reinvestment plan or transferring part of your holdings into offshore mutual funds. Also, keep in mind the LRS (Liberalised Remittance Scheme) cap of $250,000 if you’re planning remittances for family. I will coordinate with our tax advisor on the new DTAA clarifications. Regarding real estate—your Hyderabad property can be moved into REITs for better liquidity.",
    "We also discussed optimizing the USD-INR hedge. Currently, you're overexposed to rupee volatility. One approach is to move part of your holdings into dollar-denominated fixed-income instruments. On estate planning—please complete the notarization of your Indian will. I'll work with the family office to align nominees across your mutual funds and PPF. Additionally, the RBI circular on NRO repatriation has been updated—you'll need form 15CB from a CA for future transfers."
